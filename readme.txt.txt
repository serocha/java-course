When I started this course, the majority of the videos had been recorded in 2018. The course
received a large update of remastered content in 2022 with better exercises, higher production 
values, and a little bit of content covering what's new in JDK 17.

I've split my coursework into two sections: JDK 11 and JDK 17. This title ONLY reflects which 
version of the course the projects relate to, as the chapter numbering is different between 
versions. I'll be adding to the JDK 17 folder as the remastered videos come out.

Parts of my code in the JDK 11 section will contain the use of JDK 17 features, such as enhanced 
switch statments.
